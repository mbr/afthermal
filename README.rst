afthermal
=========

``afthermal`` is a driver/library for the https://www.adafruit.com/products/597
thermal printer [1].

Partially, it is inspired by previous efforts:

* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library
* https://github.com/adafruit/Python-Thermal-Printer/
* https://github.com/luopio/py-thermal-printer/

It does try to be a little more pythonic and efficient than previous efforts,
which have mostly been 1:1 ports from other languages.
